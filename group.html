                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Crossing Thresholds -- <i>somatic grief and transition group</i></strong> 
                            <p>
                                Crossing Thresholds is a structured yet process-oriented group for individuals navigating separation, divorce, or significant relational endings. Participants explore the emotional and bodily dimensions of grief—anger, sadness, denial, longing, and reorientation—while learning to track cycles of experience over time. Through somatic awareness, relational exercises, and group dialogue, members develop contact statements that articulate where they are and where they are moving. The group culminates in a ritual witnessing session, marking a threshold between what has been lost and what is beginning.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The Art of Contact -- <i>somatic group</i></strong> 
                           <p>
                            This group is for those whose bodies have learned to survive through distance, self-reliance, and emotional containment. Together, we explore the art of contact—learning how to be touched and to touch without disappearing, how to remain present while in connection, and how to sense one’s own needs and limits. Through embodied practices and relational experimentation, participants develop greater flexibility, emotional literacy, and capacity for intimacy.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Anchoring the Heart -- <i>somatic group</i></strong> 
                            <p>
                                Anchoring the Heart is designed for individuals who experience emotional intensity, pressurized longing, and a persistent sense of urgency in relationships. The group focuses on grounding heightened activation, learning to anchor emotional experience in the body, and developing self-soothing capacities while remaining in connection. Participants practice slowing down, sensing what is needed, and cultivating steadiness without abandoning desire or relational vitality.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Women’s Group -- <i>Chinese-speaking, online</i></strong> 
                            <p>We come together to explore life purpose, values, boundaries, and relationships with parents, partners, and children. Through candid conversations and mutual feedback, participants develop self-awareness and new ways of relating—practicing saying no, acknowledging uncomfortable feelings, initiating action, and expressing themselves directly. The group offers a space to discover shared experience, strength, and connection.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Somatic Process Supervision Group</strong> 
                            <p>This bi-weekly supervision group is for therapists interested in deepening their integration of somatic practice. The group combines case consultation, experiential learning, and peer support, with an emphasis on embodied presence and relational awareness. Participants explore how their own bodily experience informs therapeutic work, gaining a more nuanced, lived understanding of client and therapist relational dynamics.</p>
